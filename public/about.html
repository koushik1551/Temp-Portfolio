<p>I am a passionate and driven individual with a strong foundation in computer science and software 
  development. With a background in C++, data structures, and algorithms, I enjoy building efficient
  and scalable solutions to complex problems. Iâ€™m particularly interested in solving real-world challenges
  through thoughtful engineering, and I continuously strive to improve both my technical skills and problem-solving
  abilities.</p>
<p>Currently, I am actively focused on mastering competitive programming, system design, and backend 
  technologies, aiming to become a world-class software engineer. My learning journey includes deep 
  dives into topics like memory management, algorithm optimization, and advanced programming paradigms.
   I enjoy taking on new challenges that push me out of my comfort zone, and I believe consistency, 
   curiosity, and persistence are key drivers of success in tech.</p>
<p>Outside of technical learning, I value clear communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement. 
  I take pride in being someone who is self-motivated, reliable, and always eager to learn. My long-term
  goal is to contribute to high-impact products at a top-tier technology company, where I can grow as both 
  a developer and a leader while making a meaningful difference through innovation.</p>
